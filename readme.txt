Students want a nice project to do in their final years. Staff want interesting projects but
not too many and to get the right student for their project. Staff have differing levels of
availability too – some can supervise just one project others’ several projects. How do we
get the optimum balance?

This project will involve developing a software service that will automatically match users
and tasks according to the users' preferences. The software will have a GUI where users
order the options and later the system will use a matching algorithm for proposing a
solution to the matching users-tasks. This can be applied to the allocation of final year
projects to students and also to assessors. The goal is to have an easy-to-use system that
can be employed in future years for instance in the allocation of project of CSC3002.
